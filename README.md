# AMP_Global
Antimicrobial peptides are a promising new class of antimicrobials that could address the antibiotic resistance crisis, which poses a major threat to human health. Here we identify the biosynthetic potential of antimicrobial peptides in the global microbiome and systematically quantified the risk of each resistance determinant to human health by using these codes and scripts

In the main brach, you can found the codes and scripts for annotation, analysis and visulization in our study. All the data for analysis and visualization will be uploaded as demos respectively, once our study is published.
